# cwru_davinci_cad_models

This slow changing repository stores all of the cad model files used by the rest of the cwru_davinci development suite. Most of the CAD files originally came from the [JHU dvrk suite](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros), but are included here to reduce potential problems caused by potentially buggy updates.
